# :sunflower: React Authentication With Firebase And Routing :sunflower:

The project consists in creating a Firebase Setup which is a set of hosting services for any type of application. I used Firebase for the social authentication service.

Creating the Sign up Component which includes filling out an email input, password input and an pasword confirmation input. These are saved in the Firebase database so that means an account can be created.

After creating an account the use can Log In his dashboard using the Log In component who has an email input and a password input.
